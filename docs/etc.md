### Design

- Can the list of basic concepts be shorter?
- Do any features have side effects?
- Have I hidden away the incidental complexity?
- Does this function make more assumptions about the input than totally necessary?
- Do all parts relate to each other with a concise, unifying principle?
- Does the design ever force users to use non-obvious idioms to express themselves?

> "I think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our own democracy is still before us. And I think that all these things are certain as the morning, as inevitable as noon. I think I speak for most men living when I say that our America is Here, is Now, and beckons on before us, and that this glorious assurance is not only our living hope, but our dream to be accomplished."
