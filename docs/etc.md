# Ideas

Great ideas, ripe for the pickin'.

- There's gotta be a better way for babies to fly. What would economics of that look like?
- Drag n drop fixed set of unix tools site - drag n drop sed, xargs, etc, could run on lambda with subprocessing, limit downsides?
- Shell combos generator / guide
- Apex for hosting / deploying a static site to your own s3 bucket?
- Motorized land vehicle RC - simulate boat on water, rollers underneath, etc.
- Seatswap.io - helpful site for seat swaps
- Code challenge site - halite for basic programming skills, connect companies and learners, something about lambda school
- Hotel rooms with premium stuff on sale
- Skiing - watch coordinated paths on 3d map through time using skitracks files
- CX blog for all company experiences
- Service to call and wait on hold for you, and call you when it's ready
- Uber for storage
- AI for sorting grocery lists
- Musician tipping app, because no one carries cash (QR code, straight to venmo> Just venmo?)
- Thanks and sorry lights back of car
- Queue line with finite amount of choices for switching lines - feeling of agency and order
- Ad network across multiple sites with opt-ins to reasonable policies
- Better map sharing service online
- Installable window screens with flexible edges for tight fitting
- Some twitter plugin whereby tweets get categorized using NLP / mechanical
    turks - to highlight likelihood a tweet is just signaling, actually true,
    based on user's past tweets and reliable past categorization
- Computer vision for plant veins area analysis
- Stackable rubber rings for storing pan lids
- Hibachi for other cuisines
- Customer discounts for helpful behavior
    - Ride share - pay more faster arrival
    - Scooters - parking optimization

## Site

- Store some stuff in more structured way - even just text files that go out on deployment (books are good example here)
- Black background
- auto-gen page history
- outlines are better than blogposts in that they don't age, but you lose style.
- designs for inventions
- publish dotfiles, other greatest hits for github
- generate one-time shopping list - copy s3 file or something?










### Design

- Can the list of basic concepts be shorter?
- Do any features have side effects?
- Have I hidden away the incidental complexity?
- Does this function make more assumptions about the input than totally necessary?
- Do all parts relate to each other with a concise, unifying principle?
- Does the design ever force users to use non-obvious idioms to express themselves?


## Quotes

> "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew."
>> Marshall McLuhan

<br>
> "If it doesn't engage me, I leave it. I do not do homework with my life."
> - Guillermo del Toro

<br>
> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
> - Richard Feynman

<br>
> "I think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our own democracy is still before us. And I think that all these things are certain as the morning, as inevitable as noon. I think I speak for most men living when I say that our America is Here, is Now, and beckons on before us, and that this glorious assurance is not only our living hope, but our dream to be accomplished."
> - Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again

<br>
> "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
> - Theodore Roosevelt

<br>
> "The love for all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man."
> - Charles Darwin

<br>
> "All meetings should be ten minutes or two hours."

<br>
> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. –Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

<br>
> The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively communicate ideas. – Gastón Jorquera

<br>
> The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak. –Hans Hofmann

<br>
> Design is the art of arranging code to work today, and be changeable forever. – Sandi Metz

<br>
> If software cannot be maintained, it will be rewritten.

_The Second Coming_, by Yeats:


> Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
> The best lack all conviction, while the worst
> Are full of passionate intensity.
>
> Surely some revelation is at hand;
> Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
> The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
> Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
> Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
>
> The darkness drops again but now I know
> That twenty centuries of stony sleep
> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
