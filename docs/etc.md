## Site

- Store some stuff in more structured way - even just text files that go out on deployment (books are good example here)
- Black background
- auto-gen page history
- outlines are better than blogposts in that they don't age, but you lose style.
- designs for inventions
- publish dotfiles, other greatest hits for github
- generate one-time shopping list - copy s3 file or something?



### Design

- Can the list of basic concepts be shorter?
- Do any features have side effects?
- Have I hidden away the incidental complexity?
- Does this function make more assumptions about the input than totally necessary?
- Do all parts relate to each other with a concise, unifying principle?
- Does the design ever force users to use non-obvious idioms to express themselves?

_The Second Coming_, by Yeats:


> Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
> The best lack all conviction, while the worst
> Are full of passionate intensity.
>
> Surely some revelation is at hand;
> Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
> The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
> Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
> Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
>
> The darkness drops again but now I know
> That twenty centuries of stony sleep
> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
