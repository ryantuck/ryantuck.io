# Hot Sauce

I had a friend reach out and ask me for some hot sauce recommendations because I've become known in some circles as "the hot sauce guy" who started curating a hot sauce collection after one time getting a $150 gift certificate to hotsauce.com many moons ago and figuring I might as well spend it all at once.

Anyway, here's some of my thoughts on hot sauces in case they help!

But before reading my dumb anecdotal takes, check out hotsauce.com or heatonist.com for a whole lot more.


## Hip and indie

### Encona

Encona is a west indian hot sauce from the UK. It's hot and super flavorful. Would bathe in it if that weren't asking for trouble.

You can [buy it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Encona-Hot-Pepper-Sauce-Original/dp/B004QVL4CW) but apparently can't find it anywhere else!

### Secret Aardvark

This stuff is dank. Sweet. All that. Spicy, but not too hot.

### La Diablesse

Got this as a gift one time. Mustardy. Delicious. Decently spicy but not unbearable.

### Hank Sauce

These guys are from NJ, along with some other greats like Tony Soprano, myself, and the boss.

### Hoff Sauce

My team at work got a box of this somehow and gave it to me. Out of Chattanooga, TN. Really great, especially love the green hot sauce. Not too spicy but super delicious.

## Mexico / South America

Cholula is fine, but old news. There are some real baddies south of the border that even a piece of shit like Trump wouldn't wanna lock in a cage upon entry.

Gonna rank these bad boys because why not.

### 1. El Yucateco

Oh mama, the sweet sweet thick green goop that makes my heart sing and my insides bleed. How I love you so.

### 2. Tapatio

Tio is spanish for uncle. Tapatio is spanish for delicious and not-too-spicy versatile hot sauce for putting on absolutely anything. A little smokier than the second best versatile mexican hot sauce, which is ...

### 3. Valentina

Valentina is all-around delicious, and I've spent many evenings alone with a bag of tortilla chips and Valentina constituting "dinner".

### 4. Marie Sharp's

There are like 600 different flavors that Marie Sharp's sells and they're probably all good because I haven't found one I don't like. They range from palatable to way too hot.

## Hot as balls

If you wanna bring the pain, I support it.

### Satan's Blood

If you plan to commit yourself to the spicy life, get yourself a bottle of [Satan's Blood](https://www.hotsauce.com/satans-blood-chile-extract/) pure chile extract. It is absolutely the upper limit on  what the body is capable of handling, as far as I can tell.

**How not to handle** - don't have a chili cook off at work, bring this in to flex on everyone, touch the bottle, go to the bathroom, show up to a meeting, then 5 minutes later feel your dick igniting in flames because you didn't wash your hands _before_ peeing.

### Ghost pepper hot sauce

There are a ton of ghost pepper hot sauces out there and they probably all taste the goddamn same, which is _fuckin' hot_. Really bangs you up if you use enough and do it right.
