- Shell combos generator / guide
- Apex for hosting / deploying a static site to your own s3 bucket?
- Motorized land vehicle RC - simulate boat on water, rollers underneath, etc.
- Seatswap.io - helpful site for seat swaps
- Code challenge site - halite for basic programming skills, connect companies and learners, something about lambda school
- Hotel rooms with premium stuff on sale
- Skiing - watch coordinated paths on 3d map through time using skitracks files
- CX blog for all company experiences
- Service to call and wait on hold for you, and call you when it's ready
- Uber for storage
- AI for sorting grocery lists
- Musician tipping app, because no one carries cash (QR code, straight to venmo> Just venmo?)
