# me



## work

I'm currently the tech lead on Warby Parker's business intelligence team.

My main two tools in the toolbox are python and SQL.

I'm very fond of ops.

### LIT

Prior to my current role, I tried to start a company designing [LED headbands for raves](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/litlitlit/halo-rave-gear-revolutionized).

This involved teaching myself electrical engineering, PCB design and fabrication, and a whole lot of C++.
