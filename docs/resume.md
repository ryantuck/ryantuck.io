# Resume

## tl;dr

I'm seeking challenging work solving meaningful problems in a fast-paced organization that values experimentation, vision, ownership, open source, first-principles thinking, and skin in the game.

I bring a deep understanding and product-focused competence in modern data engineering patterns, tooling, and deliverability, and thrive in both heavily-technical and business-facing environments.

My background in physics, philosophy, entrepreneurship, and electrical engineering has instilled in me a deep appreciation for intellectual rigor, creativity, and practical approaches to problem-solving.

I'm scrappy, resourceful, can own and manage projects and products, and am ready to hit the ground running on day 0. Let's chat.
