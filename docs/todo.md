## Site

- set up email forwarding
- Store some stuff in more structured way - even just text files that go out on deployment (books are good example here)
- Black background
- auto-gen page history
- make sure mobile doesn't look like shit
- outlines are better than blogposts in that they don't age, but you lose style.
- don't require carats around links
