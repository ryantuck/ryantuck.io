# vim

- `q:` - command line history
- `q/` - search history
- `:sort u` - sort the file
- `:set tw=80` for soft word wrap, and works with outlines
- `gU` converts selection to ALL CAPS
- `gu` converts selection to lowercase
- `:! <command>` - run commands in vim
- `g_` goes to last non-blank character
- `P` pastes before cursor
- `:let` shows all vars
- `:set linebreak` allows for soft line wraps
- `:set columns=80` will limit the maximum number of columns to display to 80. This works nicely with `:set linebreak` to create a nice UI for writing text.
- `:g/=/d` will delete all lines that contain `=`
